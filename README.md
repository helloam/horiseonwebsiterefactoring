# horiseonwebsiterefactoring

This repo's purpose is to show my attemp at refactoring for the first time. In this activity, I needed to review a fictitious business' website for any parts of the code that needed cleaning up and improved so that it not only meets accessibility standards, but also that it was optimized for search engines.

Except for a part in the html where I removed the header from a div class - most of the improvements I made were within the CSS, consolidating selectors and property values that were the same to  minimize repetition, and then minifying to reduce the file size hence enhancing the overall loading of the website.
